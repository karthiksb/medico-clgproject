Now\r\n            all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.\r\n            Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and\r\n            change your opinions manually!\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            How much did you make me? Why would I want to know that? Actually,\r\n            that's still true. Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because\r\n            you can see her spewers? Oh, how awful. Did he at least die\r\n            painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up?\r\n            …To shreds, you say.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Guess again. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Look, everyone wants to be\r\n            like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?\r\n            Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Now that the,\r\n            uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with\r\n            my sexual inhibitions?\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites?\r\n            Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think\r\n            it would be something you'd have to freebase. Why did you bring us\r\n            here?\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll\r\n            go ride the bumper cars. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I\r\n            care what you think? Hey, tell me something. You've got all this\r\n            money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's\r\n            costume? And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's\r\n            gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. A sexy\r\n            mistake.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Yes, except the Dave Matthews\r\n            Band doesn't rock. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say!\r\n            How can any of us trust you? I'll get my kit!\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a\r\n            suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! Robot 1-X,\r\n            save my friends! And Zoidberg! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm\r\n            going to come back there and change your opinions manually!\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go\r\n            home. You mean while I'm sleeping in it? With gusto. Can I use the\r\n            gun? This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack\r\n            subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they\r\n            feel. That makes me feel angry!\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Anyone who laughs is a communist! Perhaps, but perhaps your\r\n            civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above\r\n            you! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack\r\n            subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they\r\n            feel. That makes me feel angry!\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Navbar;\r\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AACA,SAASC,aAAa,IAAIC,MAA1B,EAAkCC,MAAlC,EAA0CC,KAA1C,EAAiDC,IAAjD,QAA6D,kBAA7D;;;AAEA,SAASC,MAAT,GAAkB;EAChB,oBACE;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,iBAAf;IAAA,wBACE;MAAA,uBACE;QAAK,KAAK,EAAC,MAAX;QAAA,uBACE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA;MADF;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA;IADF;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QADF,eAME;MAAK,KAAK,EAAC,UAAX;MAAA,uBACE;QAAK,KAAK,EAAC,yBAAX;QAAA,uBACE;UAAI,KAAK,EAAC,MAAV;UAAA,wBACE;YAAA,uBACE;cAAG,IAAI,EAAC,GAAR;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA;UADF;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QADF,eAIE;YAAA,uBACE;cAAG,IAAI,EAAC,GAAR;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA;UADF;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAJF,eAOE;YAAA,uBACE;cAAG,IAAI,EAAC,GAAR;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA;UADF;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAPF,eAUE;YAAA,uBACE;cAAG,IAAI,EAAC,GAAR;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA;UADF;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAVF;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA;MADF;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA;IADF;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QANF,eAwBE;MAAK,KAAK,EAAC,SAAX;MAAA,uBACE;QAAK,KAAK,EAAC,WAAX;QAAA,wBACE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QADF,eAKE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QALF,eASE;UAAA,4IAE2D,GAF3D,eAGE;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAHF,EAG+C,GAH/C,eAIE;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAJF;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QATF,eAeE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAfF,eAmBE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAnBF,eAwBE;UAAA,wBACE;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QADF,eAKE;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QALF,eAME;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QANF;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAxBF,eAiCE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAjCF,eAkCE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAlCF,eAwCE;UAAA,wBACE;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QADF,eAKE;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QALF,eAME;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QANF;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAxCF,eAoDE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QApDF,eA2DE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA3DF,eAiEE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAjEF,eAwEE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAxEF,eA+EE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA/EF,eAqFE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QArFF,eA2FE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA3FF,eAiGE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAjGF,eAsGE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAtGF,eA4GE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA5GF,eAmHE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAnHF;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA;IADF;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QAxBF;EAAA;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QADF;AAwJD;;KAzJQA,M;AA2JT,eAAeA,MAAf"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
